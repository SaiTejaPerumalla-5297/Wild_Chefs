  <ul>
        <li>
        <h2> {
          Color :red;} 
          Building the Repo</h2><br> I Learned alot about merge and deletion.<br>
          <h2>Any difficulties with a merge? Merges are kind of unavoidable, but good team flow and informal communication helps alot.</h2><br>
          <h3>Iam new to the git hub and learning about the commands now, in that process i kind of faced difficulty while merging my code with other team members, going forward will work with my team collectively.</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2> {
          Color :red;}
              CLI Learns</h2> Learned about CLI commands and how we are merging and Deleting files.<br>
             <h2>What was the most useful CLI command you learned? Look up some additional shortcuts, try one new one and write about your experience here.</h2><br>
             <h3>Today, I tried using the !! command, which repeats the last command you ran. It‚Äôs surprisingly handy, especially when you forget to prepend sudo to a command. <br>
              $ apt update
              Permission denied
              $ sudo !!
             <br>At first, it felt a little odd trusting a "magic" shortcut, but after a few tries, I realized how much time it saves. It prevents retyping and is especially useful during package installations or system-level operations. It also makes me feel more efficient‚Äîlike I‚Äôm speaking the computer‚Äôs native language.</h3>
