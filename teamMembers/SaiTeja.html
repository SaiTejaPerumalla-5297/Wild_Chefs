    <h2>Kent Beck</h2>
    <p>Kent Beck is a pioneer in modern software development practices. He has influenced the way developers write, test, and deliver code.</p>
    <ul class="kent-beck-points">
      <li><strong>Cost of Software</strong> One of the main points where I found it intresting is that how cost of Software is related to many things. Initially, cost of software is dependent on changes, changes might be big, big changes are related to coupling which says indirectly Cost of software is dependent on coupling which means the change in code from one to another.</li>
      <li><strong>3X model</strong> Man 3X model is a great thing to understand from an investor point of view, where  it stands for Explore, Expand and Extract. This is purely exceptional to talk about.</li>
      <li><strong>My Fav Line</strong> This one is not an actuall concept of him but a statement that is great. "Software is not Assembled", this can be explained in many ways and thats really fantastic!!! </li>
