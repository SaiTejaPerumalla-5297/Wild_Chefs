            <h2>Building the Repo</h2><br>Learned alot about building the repo, not just building the repo but handling
            different errors we might or have faced.
        <li class="profspeak">Running into problems teaches us WAY more than proceeding successfully. I'm glad you have
            such a good perspective!</li>

            <h2>CLI Learns</h2> I being keyboard person learnt loads and loads of shortcuts and using the cmd or git
            bash always makes you feel like a tech geek.
        <li class="profspeak">Oh man I feel you on that. I feel like some movie hacker everytime I learn a new CLI
            shortcut.</li>
