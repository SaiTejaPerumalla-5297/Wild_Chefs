    <h1>My Learnings</h1>
    <ul>
        <h2>Github Learnings</h2><br><li><p>I learned a lot about github and its usage in many aspects</p>
        </li><br>          
    <li class="profspeak"><b>What do you wish you would have known before starting your MS project?</b></li>
        </li>
        <li><p>I wish I would have known about how useful github can be in terms of organising various things related to my MS Project like tracking the changes, uploading the code,collaborationg on the code, how i can manage issues with respect to my 
            project by making use of github issues and also for making the project documentation reachable for everyone</p></li>
        
            <h2>CLI Command Learnings</h2><br><li><p>Learnt a lot about CLI commands how they can be used to add update delete files</p></li><br>
        <li class="profspeak">I'm glad! No need to respond to this one.</li>

          <h2>Idea-Feature-Structure Model</h2><br>
          <p>The Idea-Feature-Structure model reinforces the principle that software design should be incremental, feedback-driven, and economically informed. 
            It encourages to begin with understanding the problem (idea), express it in usable form (feature), and only then invest in internal systems (structure). 
            This layered approach not only promotes adaptability and efficiency but also aligns software development with real-world value creation.</p><br>
          <h2><b>Why software is grown not assembled?</b></h2><br>
          <p>When you grow a plant, we start with a seed, plant it in soil, water it, and give it sunlight. 
            Then over time, we observe how it grows. Sometimes it needs more water, sometimes less sunlight. 
            we have to adjust based on how it responds. In the same way, when we build software, we don’t know everything at the beginning.
             We start small, write simple code, and then improve it as we get feedback from users or from testing.</p><br>
             <p>Assembling software would be like building a chair: You have a fixed plan and all the parts are ready. 
                But software doesn’t work like that because requirements keep changing.
                Hence, approaches like Extreme Programming and agile focus on short cycles, testing, and adapting as it requires care, observation, and constant adjustments.
